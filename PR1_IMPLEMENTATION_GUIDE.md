## Overview

This guide documents the implementation of PR #1 which includes all authentication screens and the core authentication flow for the LifeEase healthcare application.

## Implemented Features

**Purpose**: Initial app loading screen with animations

**Key Features**:
- Animated logo with scale and rotation effects
- Text fade-in and slide animations
- Progress indicator
- Pulse animation effect
- Automatic navigation to login after 3 seconds

**Implementation Details**:
```dart
// Multiple animation controllers for different effects
- Logo scale animation (0.0 to 1.0 with elastic curve)

- Text fade and slide animations
- Progress bar animation
- Pulse effect for visual appeal
```

**Navigation Flow**:
```

3. Wait for UserProvider to load user profile
4. Route based on user role:
   - Doctor → /doctor/home
   - Admin → /admin/home
   - Patient (default) → /patient/home

// Error handling
- Display SnackBar with error message
- Reset loading state
```

**Role-Based Routing**:
```dart
switch (role) {
  case 'doctor':
    context.go('/doctor/home');
    break;
  case 'admin':
    context.go('/admin/home');
    break;
  default:
    context.go('/patient/home');
}
```

## Dependencies

### Services

#### AuthService (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`)
Handles Firebase Authentication operations:
```dart
- signUpWithEmail(email, password) → UserCredential
- signInWithEmail(email, password) → UserCredential
- sendPasswordResetEmail(email) → void
- signOut() → void
- currentUser → User?
- authStateChanges → Stream<User?>
```

#### UserService (`lib/services/user_service.dart`)
Manages user profiles in Firestore:
```dart
- createUserProfile(uid, email, name, role, photoURL, phone) → void
- getUserProfile(uid) → User?
- watchUserProfile(uid) → Stream<User?>
```

### Providers

#### UserProvider (`lib/providers/user_provider.dart`)
Manages authentication and user state:
```dart
Properties:
- isLoading: bool
- isAuthenticated: bool
- uid: String?
- role: String?
- profile: User?

Methods:
- refreshProfile() → Future<void>

Listens to:
- Firebase Auth state changes
- Automatically loads user profile from Firestore
```

### Models

#### User Model (`lib/models/user.dart`)
```dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String role; // 'patient', 'doctor', 'admin'
  final String email;
  final String name;
  final String? phone;
  final DateTime? dateOfBirth;
  final String? address;
  
  toMap() → Map<String, dynamic>
  fromMap(Map<String, dynamic>) → User
}
```

### Configuration

#### Firebase Configuration (`firebase_options.dart`)
- Auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI
- Contains platform-specific Firebase configuration
- Includes API keys, project IDs, storage buckets, etc.

#### App Configuration (`lib/config/app_config.dart`)
```dart
- API keys
- Firebase project details
- App name and settings
- Environment flags (production/development)
```

#### Theme (`lib/utils/theme.dart`)
```dart
- Primary color: Blue
- Material 3 design
- Adaptive platform density
```

#### Constants (`lib/utils/constants.dart`)
```dart
- Primary color: #2196F3
- API base URL
```

### Routes

#### App Routes (`lib/routes/app_routes.dart`)
Complete route configuration with authentication guards:

**Auth Routes**:
```
/splash → SplashScreen
/login → LoginScreen
/signup → SignUpScreen
/forgot-password → ForgotPasswordScreen
/otp-verification → OTPVerificationScreen
```

**Protected Routes** (require authentication):
- Patient routes: /patient/*
- Doctor routes: /doctor/*
- Admin routes: /admin/*
- Common routes: /settings, /support

**Route Guard**:
```dart
redirect: (context, state) {
  final userProvider = Provider.of<UserProvider>(context, listen: false);
  if (userProvider.role == 'guest' && !isAuthRoute) {
    return '/login';
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Firebase Setup Requirements

### 1. Firebase Authentication
Enable the following sign-in methods in Firebase Console:
- Email/Password authentication
- (Optional) Phone authentication for OTP
- (Optional) Google Sign-In
- (Optional) Facebook Sign-In

### 2. Firestore Database
Create the following collections:

**users** collection:
```
users/{userId}
  - id: string
  - email: string
  - name: string
  - role: string ('patient' | 'doctor' | 'admin')
  - phone: string?
  - photoURL: string?
  - dateOfBirth: timestamp?
  - address: string?
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
```

### 3. Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User profiles
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own profile
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can write their own profile
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Admins can read/write all profiles
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Firebase Storage (Optional)
If using avatar uploads:
- Create storage bucket
- Configure storage security rules
- Implement upload in StorageService

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **OTP Verification**: Currently placeholder implementation
   - Need to integrate Firebase Phone Authentication
   - Need to implement actual OTP sending and verification
   
2. **Avatar Upload**: Commented out in signup
   - Need to implement StorageService.uploadUserAvatar()
   - Need to handle image compression and optimization

3. **Social Login**: UI placeholders only
   - Google Sign-In needs configuration
   - Facebook Sign-In needs configuration

4. **Role Verification**: No backend verification
   - Doctor role should require verification/approval
   - Admin role should be manually assigned

### Future Enhancements
1. **Email Verification**: Add email verification step after signup
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for enhanced security
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Face ID / Touch ID support
4. **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling
5. **Account Deletion**: Add account deletion functionality
6. **Profile Completion**: Force profile completion for doctors
7. **Terms and Conditions**: Add T&C acceptance during signup
