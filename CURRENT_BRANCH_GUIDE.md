## Current Status

**All files in this branch already exist in the base commit!**

This means:
1. The authentication and patient screens are already implemented
2. All necessary dependencies and services are present
3. The code is ready for review and testing

## Next Steps

### Option 1: If this branch should only contain auth + patient screens
Since all files already exist in the base, we need to create a clean branch that:
1. Starts from a base without any screens
2. Adds only auth + patient screens
3. Adds only their required dependencies

This would require coordination with the repository owner to create a proper base branch.

### Option 2: If all screens should remain together
Keep the current structure where all screens exist together, and use the PR organization plan for future development of additional features like:
- Advanced services (real_time_service, security_service, notification_service, etc.)
- Additional providers
- Enhanced configuration
- Integration implementations

## Recommendation

Given that all screens already exist in the base commit, I recommend:

1. **Keep the current structure** - All screens are already implemented and working together
2. **Focus on enhancements** - Use future PRs to add:
   - Missing services (notification, real-time, telemedicine, security, etc.)
   - Additional providers for better state management
   - Enhanced configuration and feature flags
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Integration implementations (Agora video, AI recommendations, etc.)

3. **Review and Test** - Use this PR to:
   - Review the authentication flow
   - Test patient screens functionality
   - Verify routing and navigation
   - Ensure proper error handling
